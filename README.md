# Alternative Pikabu site with a mobile app API

Pikabu, but with "Best" and stability. No experiments on the part of the Pikabu team, 
that "improve" the interface (until they break the API, of course).

Works on the client side (after getting the API key). You need a CORS proxy to work properly 
(or disable CORS protection in your browser).

## If you want just the API

Then go [here](https://github.com/PyXiion/Pikabu/blob/master/pukabu/static/js/pikabu/api.mjs).

I haven't written a full-fledged library, but there is a function for generating requests for Pikabu API.
